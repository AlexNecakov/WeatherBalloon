# Weather Balloon/HPR
This is the PlatformIO project code for the cancelled Weather Balloon project for BURPG. This code is largely reused from the flight software for the K3 HPR (High Powered Rocket) and was only deployed for use on the HPR project. This project was developed in the Arduino Framework, using PlatformIO for deployment, and as such, has all of the PlatformIO project structure and default files. This project is intended to be deployed on an [Adafruit Feather M0 with LoRa Radio](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3178), using the standard PlatformIO deployment steps. Libraries are currently not included in this project, and would need to be installed to the /lib/ folder. This project polls from several sensors using mostly preexisting Adafruit Libraries, formats the data into a char array packet, and transmits it using the LoRa radio. This code was mostly repurposed for the [PUCKFish](https://github.com/AlexNecakov/PUCKFish) project, and exists in a much more complete state in that repository.
